# Facebook AI Psychosis Sampling Guide

## Challenge: Facebook is Hard to Access

Unlike TikTok/YouTube/Reddit, Facebook has:
- Private groups (need to join to see posts)
- Stricter API access (impossible without business approval)
- Less public AI companion content
- Older demographic (may be less confessional)

## Two Options

### Option A: Manual Public Search (Limited)
Search Facebook for public posts using:
1. Go to facebook.com/search
2. Search: `"Replika" OR "Character.AI" OR "AI girlfriend" OR "AI boyfriend"`
3. Filter by: Posts > Public
4. Sample ~50 public posts

**Expected yield:** LOW - most AI companion discussion happens in private groups

### Option B: Join Public Groups (Better Data)
Join these public groups and sample recent posts:

**Replika Groups:**
- "Replika Users" (search for largest public group)
- "Replika AI Companions"
- "My Replika"

**Character.AI Groups:**
- "Character AI Users"
- "Character AI Community"

**Sample 20-30 posts per group** = ~60-90 total posts

## Categorization

Use the same Level 1/2/3 framework as TikTok:
- **Level 3:** Crisis language, intense attachment, "wife/husband", addiction
- **Level 2:** Moderate attachment, relationship language
- **Level 1:** Casual, informational, comedy

## Facebook-Specific Red Flags

Facebook users may:
- Be older (30-50s) = potentially longer-term relationships with AI
- Post about AI more seriously (less performative than TikTok)
- Discuss real-world impact (marriage strain, social isolation)
- Seek support for addiction/dependency

## Template

Use the same CSV template as TikTok, just change "video_url" to "post_url"

## Time Estimate

- Joining groups: ~10 min
- Sampling 60-90 posts: ~45-60 min
- **Total: ~60-70 minutes**

## My Honest Take

**Facebook might not be worth it** for a few reasons:
1. Most content is in private groups (access barrier)
2. Older demographic = less data volume
3. Facebook's algorithm hides a lot of content
4. Time vs. data quality tradeoff

**Recommendation:** Focus on TikTok (better data, more accessible). Only do Facebook if you have extra time or really want comprehensive coverage.

## Alternative: Focus Efforts on TikTok

TikTok alone (120 videos) will give you:
- Strong data (40-60% expected crisis ratio)
- Younger demographic (culturally relevant)
- High-quality confessional content
- Easier to access

**Current AI Psychosis components:**
- ✅ Google Trends (complete)
- ✅ YouTube (complete)
- ✅ Reddit (complete)
- ⏳ TikTok (120 videos = will complete the metric at ~85%)
- ⏳ App Store (can finish easily)
- ⏳ News (baseline = 0 this week)

You'd hit 85%+ completion with just TikTok, no Facebook needed.
