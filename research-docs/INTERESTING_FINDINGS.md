##  GOOGLE TRENDS INSIGHTS

### What People Are Actually Searching For
High scores = high search volume = real pain

**Housing crisis:** 52.50/100 (people are SEARCHING for escape)
**Need a raise:** 50.65/100 (desperate wage searches)
**Customer service complaints:** 42.49/100 (constant frustration)

##  DATA COLLECTION LESSONS

### The Underestimation Factor
People are really bad at knowing how much they spend on subscriptions. The gap is 2.5x.

**Why this matters:**
- Shows the frog-in-boiling-water effect
- $10 here, $15 there, suddenly $273/month
- Great for "fun facts" section
- Shareable ("I just counted mine and OH MY GOD")

### The Hidden Categories
Nobody thinks about:
- Cloud storage as a subscription
- Password managers
- VPNs
- Software that used to be one-time purchase
- Car features (some brands tried to make heated seats a subscription)
- Gaming subscriptions
- Delivery passes

**Add them all up:** Easily $400+/month if you're a creative professional who games

##  WEIRD PATTERNS WE NOTICED

### The Google Trends Paradox
- High search volume = people looking for SOLUTIONS
- Low search volume ≠ problem doesn't exist
- Dating apps: low Google, high Reddit (social complaint)
- Subscriptions: high "cancel" searches = active escape attempts
- Housing: high searches = desperation

### The Acceleration
Everything is getting worse FASTER:
- CEO pay ratio: 268→285 in one year
- Subscription price increases: 62%→73% in one year
- Tech layoffs: 2024 = 58% of ALL layoffs since 2020

### The Awareness Gap
People don't realize how bad things are:
- Underestimate subscription spending by 2.5x
- Think unemployment is low (it is officially, but try getting a job)
- Don't connect daily frustrations to systemic issues

**This dashboard makes it visible.**
