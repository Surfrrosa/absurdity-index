# Subscription Overload Index - Data Collection
**Updated:** Dec 16, 2024

## THE PROBLEM IS BIGGER THAN STREAMING

**Original metric:** Streaming Service Fatigue Index
**Revised metric:** Subscription Overload Index

**Why:** Because subscription hell isn't just Netflix. It's Adobe, Spotify, DoorDash, Peloton, iCloud, your fucking car's heated seats, and 50 other things you forgot you're paying for.

## REAL DATA COLLECTED

### Average Consumer Spending (2024)

**The Awareness Gap:**
- What people THINK they spend: $86/month
- What they ACTUALLY spend: $219/month
- **Underestimation factor: 2.5x**

**For Video Streaming Alone:**
- Forbes estimate: $39/month
- Deloitte survey: $69/month
- (Just ONE category of subscriptions)

### Average Number of Subscriptions

**Overall:**
- Average: **12 subscriptions** per person
- Millennials: **17 subscriptions**
- Gen X: 14 subscriptions
- Boomers: 7 subscriptions

**Alternative Data (Lower Estimate):**
- Average: 2.8 active paid subscriptions
- Down from 4.1 in 2023, 4.4 in 2022

**Reality:** The 12 subscriptions figure is more accurate because it includes:
- Entertainment (streaming, music, gaming)
- Software (Adobe, Microsoft, etc.)
- Utilities (cloud storage, VPN)
- Delivery passes
- Fitness apps
- Everything else

### Subscription Economy Growth

**Market Size:**
- 2024: $593 billion globally

### The Subscription Management App Market

**Rocket Money (formerly Truebill):**
- 5 million+ users
- Helped cancel $155M+ in unused subscriptions
- Total savings: $1 billion+
- **The fact that this app exists and has 5M users proves the problem is real**

**What This Tells Us:**
- People can't track their own subscriptions
- Many forgotten/unused subscriptions
- Need third-party help to manage recurring payments
- This is a SYMPTOM of subscription overload

## SUBSCRIPTION OVERLOAD INDEX - SCORING FORMULA

```
= (monthly_spend_as_pct_disposable_income * 0.30) +
  (average_subscription_count_deviation * 0.20) +
  (price_increase_velocity_2024 * 0.20) +
  (awareness_gap_index * 0.15) +
  (google_trends_cancel_fatigue * 0.10) +
  (reddit_complaint_volume * 0.05)
```

### Component Calculations

**1. Monthly Spend as % of Disposable Income (cap 30)**
```
Median household income: $83,730/year
Average monthly gross: $6,977
Estimated disposable income: ~60% = $4,186/month

Current avg subscription spend: $273/month
Percentage: $273 / $4,186 = 6.5%

Historical baseline (2018): ~4.0%

Component: ((6.5 - 4.0) / 4.0) * 100 * 0.30 = 18.75
```

**2. Average Subscription Count Deviation (cap 20)**
```
Current average: 12 subscriptions
Historical baseline (2020): ~8 subscriptions

Deviation: ((12 - 8) / 8) * 100 * 0.20 = 10.0
```

**3. Price Increase Velocity 2024 (cap 20)**
```
Services that raised prices: 73%
Baseline (normal): 30%

Component: ((73 - 30) / 30) * 100 * 0.20 = 28.67 → CAP 20
```

**4. Awareness Gap Index (cap 15)**
```
What people think: $86/month
What they actually pay: $219/month
Gap: 2.55x underestimation

Component: (2.55 - 1.0) * 100 * 0.15 / 3 = 7.75
(Normalized to 0-15 scale)
```

**5. Google Trends Component (cap 10)**
```
TBD - Need to pull:
- "cancel subscriptions"
- "subscription fatigue"
- "too many subscriptions"
```

**6. Reddit Complaint Volume (cap 5)**
```
TBD - Need r/personalfinance sampling
```
