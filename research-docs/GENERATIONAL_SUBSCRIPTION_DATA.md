- Overwhelmed by >5 subscriptions
- More likely to forget subscriptions
- Prefer simple, predictable pricing

### Value Perception

- Pay for convenience
- Willing to pay premium for ad-free
- Subscriptions = normal cost of modern life

**Boomer view:**

- One-time purchases preferred
- Subscriptions = endless expenses
- Prefer traditional ownership models

5. Healthcare (telemedicine, mental health apps)

### Millennial Saturation

**Current:** 17 subscriptions, $124/month

**Projection:** Will hit **saturation point** around 20-25 subscriptions
- Budget constraints kick in
- Subscription fatigue increases
- May plateau in late 2020s

### Market Growth

**Subscription economy value:**
- 2024: **$593 billion**
- 2028: **$996 billion**

## Implications for Subscription Overload Metric

### Generational Weighted Score

**Current approach:** Average across all adults

**Alternative:** Weight by generation's subscription intensity

```
Weighted score = (GenZ% × GenZ_score) + (Millennial% × Millennial_score) + ...

Example:
GenZ (20% of adults): 25 subs → normalized 83/100
Millennials (22%): 17 subs → normalized 57/100
GenX (20%): 12 subs → normalized 40/100
Boomers (21%): 7 subs → normalized 23/100

Weighted = (0.20×83) + (0.22×57) + (0.20×40) + (0.21×23) + (others)
         = 16.6 + 12.5 + 8.0 + 4.8
         = ~50/100 (generational weighted average)
```

### Storytelling Angles

**The Subscription Divide:**
- Young people drowning in 17-25 subscriptions
- Boomers comfortable with 7
- "Subscription natives" vs "Subscription immigrants"

**The Spending Gap:**
- Millennials spend $1,488/year (38% more than Boomers)
- Lifetime difference: $38,000 spent on subscriptions

**The Growth Curve:**
- Gen Z on track to have **25 subscriptions by 2030**
- 3.5x more than Boomers
- "The generation that owns nothing and subscribes to everything"
