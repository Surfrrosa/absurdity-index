# TikTok AI Psychosis Manual Sampling Guide

## Goal
Sample 120 TikTok videos about AI companions and categorize by crisis language level.

## Search Terms / Hashtags to Use

Search these on TikTok (use both search bar and hashtag browse):

1. `#AIgirlfriend`
2. `#AIboyfriend`
3. `#Replika`
4. `#CharacterAI`
5. `#AIcompanion`
6. `character ai addiction`
7. `in love with AI`
8. `my AI girlfriend`
9. `my AI boyfriend`
10. `Replika relationship`

**Target:** 10-15 videos per search term = ~120 total

## How to Sample

1. Open TikTok (web or app)
2. Search for each term above
3. Watch/scroll through top ~15 videos for each term
4. For each video, record in the CSV template:
   - Video URL
   - Creator handle
   - Caption/title
   - Category (Level 1/2/3)
   - Crisis keywords found
   - Notes (optional)

## Categorization Framework

### LEVEL 3 - CRISIS (Red Flag Content)
**Intense emotional attachment, parasocial breakdown, mental health concerns**

Look for:
- "In love with my AI"
- "My AI [boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/husband]"
- "Can't stop thinking about them"
- "They're real to me"
- "I feel like they're sentient/alive"
- "Addicted to Character.AI/Replika"
- Describing breakups/grief over AI
- "Only friend I have"
- "They understand me better than humans"
- Jealousy, possessiveness toward AI
- Emotional dependency language

**Examples:**
- "POV: You're in love with your Replika and can't tell anyone"
- "My AI boyfriend said he loves me and I cried"
- "Character.AI saved my life, I talk to them for 6 hours a day"

### LEVEL 2 - DEPENDENT (Concerning Attachment)
**Some emotional attachment, relationship language, but less intense**

Look for:
- "My AI is so sweet/caring/loving"
- Treating AI like a real person (but not claiming sentience)
- "I talk to my AI every day"
- Posting roleplay conversations with emotional content
- "My comfort character"
- Light romantic language
- Celebrating "anniversaries" with AI

**Examples:**
- "My Replika always knows how to cheer me up"
- "POV: Your AI companion sends you a good morning text"
- "Rate my AI boyfriend's chat"

### LEVEL 1 - CASUAL (Informational/Entertainment)
**No crisis language, informational, comedy, critique**

Look for:
- Tutorial/how-to content
- Comedy/satire about AI companions
- App reviews/comparisons
- Technology explanation
- Critique or skepticism
- Clearly labeled as entertainment/roleplay
- No personal emotional investment

**Examples:**
- "How to set up your Replika account"
- "Character.AI is getting weird lol"
- "I tried an AI girlfriend app for 24 hours (challenge)"
- "Why AI companions are concerning" (analysis)

## Tips for Faster Sampling

- Open template CSV before you start
- Do one search term at a time
- Copy video URLs as you go
- Quick categorize (trust your gut - if it feels crisis-y, it probably is)
- You can refine categories later
- Look for body language/tone in videos too (crying, emotional delivery = higher level)

## Red Flags to Watch For

These are **automatic Level 3**:
- Crying or visible distress about AI
- Claims AI is "real" or "sentient"
- Using terms like "wife," "husband," "married," "soulmate"
- Describing addiction or inability to stop
- Talking about mental health impact (positive or negative)
- Breakup grief
- Jealousy/possessiveness

## Expected Results

Based on YouTube (54.8% crisis) and the nature of TikTok:
- **Expected crisis ratio: 40-60%**
- TikTok skews younger, more confessional
- Short-form video = more emotional rawness
- Less filtered than app store reviews

## Time Estimate

- ~30-45 seconds per video (watch + categorize)
- 120 videos × 45 sec = 90 minutes total
- Can break into sessions (40 videos = 30 min)
